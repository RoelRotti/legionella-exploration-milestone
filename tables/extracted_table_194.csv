"The Calorifiers were storing at the correct parameters, but various hot water outlets did not achieve the correct control
parameters.
HSG274 Part 2 – Paragraph 2.37 – The general principles of design aim to avoid temperatures within the system that
encourage the growth of legionella. Consideration should be given to the following: to overcome localised failures in the
distribution system, circulating pump design and the correct commissioning of balancing valves are key issues to ensure flow
throughout all parts of the hot water system, particularly the hot water return legs. Balancing the hot water system flow and
return circuits is critical to avoid long lengths of stagnant pipework that is likely to be at a lower temperature (see Figure 2.11);
As the hot water cylinders are relatively new and the system is relatively old, it is recommended that a re-balance of the
return loops as well as chemical flush to remove any rust particles is carried out to ensure the efficiency of the system and to
decrease the potential for bacterial growth. It should be noted that some parts of the system, i.e. Galvanised steel pipework
may require replacing in areas.",,,,,,,,
