Health & Safety Policy & Legionella Policy:
"At the time of visit, a copy of the schools Health & Safety Policy was not seen on site, but a copy of the policy was
emailed over. The policy shows a health and safety responsibility structure but there was no evidence provided of
a communication line. There is written evidence in section 6.2 of the policy which acknowledges Legionella as a
health and safety risk – an update of information within the policy is required due to significant changes which
have been highlighted within this risk assessment."
Written Scheme of Control:
"At the time of visit, a Written Scheme of Control document outlining what Legionella control measures are in
place for the site has not been implemented – it was noted that a water hygiene company (Envirocure Ltd) have
been carrying out control regime tasks. A Written Scheme of Control documentation should be implemented with
the findings within this risk assessment."
Management of Control Procedures:
"An up to date copy of a communication & consultation pathway was not seen on site – an implementation of this
document is required.
Envirocure Ltd were the nominated water hygiene company carrying out control regime tasks on site – all
associated paperwork was found to be up to date. Additional control regime task are required in order to comply.
There is no evidence to support that the site managers and appointed responsible people have carried out a
Legionella awareness course and/or been suitable informed/trained in carry out site specific control regime tasks."
Population at Risk:
"It should be considered that any identified risk within Parkwood Primary School are to the susceptibility of the
staff, students, visitors, and contractors using the site water services. The susceptibility of contracting legionellosis
may increase due to the known risk factors – age, heavy smoking, heavy drinking, respiratory diseases, kidney
diseases, heart diseases, diabetics, or people with impaired immune systems. At the time of visit there were no
identified personnel who are deemed ‘highly suspectable’ nor was information provided of such personnel. The
risks associated with in the building have no significant risk to the public within the surrounding area."
Hot Water Systems:
"The overall condition of the Calorifiers has been deemed very good with no indication of leaks or defects. The
internal condition of the water heaters could not be determined at the time of visit and there are no records of
internal inspections – this is due to the hot water system being brand new (boiler room only).
The associated pipeworks throughout the building are constructed from copper and galvanised steel – it should be
noted that there is a presence of brown water within various locations throughout the building as well as various
locations that were unable to achieve the correct control parameters – this may be due to a high volume of rust
within the pipeworks due to galvanic corrosion (the connection of two different mentals) or the age of the
galvanised steel pipeworks."
Hot Water Temperatures:
"At the time of visit, Calorifier 1&2 achieved a stored/flow temperature of 60°c along the flow pipework as well as
achieving a return loop pipework temperature above 50°c. Therefore, the Calorifiers have been deemed
compliant with accordance to the HSG274 Part 2.
Various hot water outlets/pipeworks temperatures were below the set control parameters but this was primarily
due to the system not circulating efficiently due to the issue highlighted above."
