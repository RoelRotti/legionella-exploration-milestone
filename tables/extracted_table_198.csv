Risk Rating:,,LOW (ADVISORY),,,,System:,,FLEXIBLE HOSES
"Flexible Hoses which supply sinks and basins have been identified throughout the building. There is no evidence and/or
confirmation of certification that they are of WRAS approval and do not contain EPDM rubber lining.
HSG274 Part 2 – section 2.35 – advised against the use of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) lined flexible hoses (tails)
as these have been shown to be a risk of microbial colonisation.
Fully quantify all flexible hoses used to supply sinks, basins and toilets within the building and implement a plan for removal.
It is recommended that flexible hoses are no longer used within the building, if bacterial problems arise within the system,
the flexible hoses should be removed.",,,,,,,,
