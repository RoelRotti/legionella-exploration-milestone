Cold Water Systems:
"The overall external condition of the Cold Water Storage Tank has been deemed satisfactory with no indication of
leaks or defects. The internal condition of the cold water storage tank showed a light level of scale deposits
around the inlet, a light staining above the water line was noted as well as a light level of debris/sediment across
the base of the cistern. There are records of previous internal inspections – which highlights that previously fitted
hollow tubes supports have been removed."
Cold Water Temperatures:
"At the time of visit the incoming water supply was below the preferred temperature of 20°c at the associated
outlets as well as the inlet to the cold water storage tank.
At the time of visit, Cold Water Storage Tank 1 achieved a stored temperature below 20°c with a <2°c differential
temperature from the incoming water supply and stored water temperature. Therefore, the cold water storage
tank has been deemed compliant with accordance to the HSG72 Part 2.
Various cold water outlets supplied via the Cold Water Storage Tank were >2°c from the stored cold water
temperature but below 20°c."
Potential for Spray Generation:
"There are spray taps located on site which are designed to create spray generation through a general daily
process.
Also, it cannot be ignored that water impacting on the surface of a basin, or the ground may produce an aerosol
or water droplets, which could be inhaled by any person using or within the vicinity of the outlet."
Limitations of the Risk Assessment:
"At the time of visit, various thermostatic mixing valves and pipework runs were inaccessibly due to furnishing and
walls."
Areas of concern beyond the scope of the Risk Assessment
There are no systems and/or equipment that are beyond the scope of this risk assessment.
