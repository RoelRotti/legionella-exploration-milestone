Microbiological Monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring for Legionella,,,,,,,,"• Water systems treated with biocides where water is stored,
or distribution temperatures are reduced. Initial testing
should be carried out monthly to provide early warning of
loss of control. The frequency of testing should be reviewed
and continued until such a time as there is confidence in the
effectiveness of the regime.
• Water systems where the control levels of the treatment
regime, e.g., temperature or disinfectant concentrations, are
not being consistently achieved. In addition to a thorough
review of the system and treatment regimes, frequent
testing, e.g., weekly, should be carried out to provide early
warning of loss of control. Once the system is brought back
under control as demonstrated by monitoring, the
frequency of testing should be reviewed.
• High-risk areas or where there is a population with increased
susceptibility, e.g., in healthcare premises including care
homes.
• Water systems suspected or identified in a case or outbreak
of legionellosis where it is probable the Incident Control
Team will require samples to be taken for analysis (see
Appendix 2.3).",,,,,,,
"HSG274 Part 2 – Paragraph 2.120 – Legionella monitoring should be carried out
where there is doubt about the efficacy of the control regime or it is known that
recommended temperatures, disinfectant concentrations, or other precautions are
not being consistently achieved through the system. The risk assessment should also
consider where it might also be appropriate to monitor in some high-risk situations
such as certain healthcare premises. The circumstances when monitoring from
legionella would be appropriate would include:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HSG274 Part 2 – Paragraph 2.122 – In both hot and cold-water systems, samples
should be taken:",,,,,,,,"• If considered necessary by the risk assessment.
• From areas where the target control parameters are not met
(i.e., where disinfectant levels are low or where
temperatures are below 50°c (55°c in healthcare premises)
for HWS or exceed 20°c for cold water systems).
• From areas subject to low usage, stagnation, excess storage
capacity, dead legs, excessive heat loss, crossflow from the
water system or other anomaly.",,,,,,,
