,,,
Aerosol,,,"A suspension in a gaseous medium of solid particles, liquid particles, or solid and liquid particles
having negligible falling velocity."
Algae,,,"A small usually aquatic plant which requires light to grow, often found on exposed areas of
cooling towers."
Air conditioning,,,"A form of air treatment whereby temperature, humidity and air cleanliness are all controlled
with limits determined by the requirements of the air-conditioned enclosure."
Antibodies,,,"Substances in the blood that destroy or neutralise various toxins or components of bacteria
known generally as antigens. The antibodies are formed because of the introduction into the
body of the antigen to which they are antagonistic as in all infectious diseases."
,Bacteria,,"A microscopic, uni-cellular (or more rarely multi-cellular) organism."
,(singular bacterium),,
Biocide,,,A substance that kills micro-organisms.
Biofilm,,,"A community of bacteria and other micro-organisms, embedded in a protective layer with
entrained debris, attached to the surface."
Blow-down/bleed-off,,,"Water discharged from the system to control the concentration of salts or other impurities in
the circulating water, usually expressed as a percentage of recirculating water flow."
Calorifier,,,"An apparatus used for the transfer of heat to water in a vessel by indirect means, the source of
heat being contained within a pipe or coil immersed in the water."
Chlorine,,,An element used in disinfection.
Cold water service,,,"Installation of plant, pipes, and fittings in which cold water is stored, distributed, and
subsequently discharged."
Cooling tower,,,"An apparatus through which warm water is discharged against an air stream; in doing so part of
the water is evaporated to saturate the air and this cools the water. The cooler water is usually
pumped to a heat exchanger to be reheated and recycled through the tower."
Concentration factor,,,"Compares the level of dissolved solids in the cooling water with that dissolved in the makeup
water (also known as cycle of concentration). Usually determined by comparison of either the
chloride or magnesium hardness concentration."
Corrosion inhibitor,,,"Chemicals which protect metals by:
(a) passivating the metal by the promotion of a thin metal oxide film (anodic inhibitors), or
(b) physically forming a thin barrier film by controlled deposition (cathodic inhibitors)."
Dead end/blind end,,,A length of pipe closed at one end through which no water passes.
Deadleg,,,"Pipes leading to a fitting through which water only passes when there is draw off from the
fitting."
Dip slide,,,"A dip slide is a means of testing the microbial content of liquids. It consists of a plastic carrier
bearing a sterile culture medium which can be dipped in the liquid to be sampled. It is then
incubated to allow microbial growth. The resulting microbial colonies are estimated by
reference to a chart."
Disinfection,,,"A process which destroys or irreversibly inactivates micro-organisms and reduces their number
to a non-hazardous level."
Distribution circuit,,,"Pipework which distributes water from hot or cold water plant to one or more
fittings/appliances."
Domestic water services,,,"Hot and cold water intended for personal hygiene, culinary, drinking water or other domestic
purposes."
Drift,,,"Circulating water lost from the tower as liquid droplets entrained in the exhaust air stream;
usually expressed as a percentage of circulating water flow but for more precise work it is part
of water per million by weight of air for a given liquid to gas ratio."
