Risk Rating:,,MEDIUM,,,,System:,,LEGIONELLA MANAGEMENT
"The site responsible person/s have not carried out a Legionella awareness course or been suitable informed/instructed on how
to carry out site specific control regime tasks.
ACoP L8 – Paragraph 51 – The duty-holder should specifically appoint a competent person or persons to take day-to-day
responsibility for controlling any identified risk from legionella bacteria, known as the ‘responsible person’. It is important for the
appointed responsible person to have sufficient authority, competence, and knowledge of the installation to ensure that all
operational procedures are carried out effectively and in a timely way. Those specifically appointed to implement the control
measures and strategies should be suitably informed, instructed and trained and their suitability assessed. They must be
properly trained to a level that ensures tasks are carried out in a safe, technically competent manner; and receive regular
refresher training. Keep records of all initial and refresher training. If a duty-holder, is self-employed or a member of a
partnership, and is competent, they may appoint themselves. The appointed responsible person should have a clear
understanding of their role and the overall health and safety management structure and policy in the organisation.
ACoP L8 – Paragraph 52 – The duty-holder should also ensure that all employees involved in work that may expose an employee
or other person to legionella are given suitable and sufficient information, instruction, and training. This includes information,
instruction, and training on the significant findings of the risk assessment and the appropriate precautions and actions they
need to take to safeguard themselves and others. This should be reviewed and updated whenever significant changes are made
to the type of work carried out or methods used. Training is an essential element of an employee’s capability to carry out work
safely, but it is not the only factor: instructions, experience, knowledge, and other personal qualities are also relevant to perform
a task safely.
It is recommended that the site responsible person/s should undertake a Legionella awareness course with certificated
evidence of completion. If the site responsible person/s are to carry out control regime tasks, suitable guidance/training
should be given and regularly refreshed to ensure competency.",,,,,,,,
