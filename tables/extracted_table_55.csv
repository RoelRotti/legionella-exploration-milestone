legs of subordinate loops, temperature
measurements can be taken on the surface of pipes
but where this is not practicable, the temperature
of water from the last outlet on each loop may be
measured and this should be greater than 50°c
within one minute of running. If the temperature
rise is slow, it should be confirmed that the outlet is
on a long leg and not that the flow and return has
failed in that local area.",,,Quarterly,,,Yes,,,"Monthly –
