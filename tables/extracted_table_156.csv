Comment:,,,"A deadleg has been located along the cold supply which
has created an area for stagnation to occur. It is
recommended if the pipework is no longer required that
it is cut as close as possible to the main run and capped.
Alternatively, flush the deadleg until an asset/outlet is
inserted.",,
