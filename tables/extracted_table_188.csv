RECOMMENDATION 2.,,,,,,,,
Risk Rating:,,MEDIUM,,,,System:,,LEGIONELLA MANAGEMENT
"A site specific, written scheme of precautions for preventing and controlling the risk of Legionella on site was not seen at the
time of visit.
ACoP L8 – Paragraph 56 – Communications and management procedures are particularly important where several people are
responsible for different aspects of the operational procedures. For example, responsibility for applying control measures may
change when shift work is involved, or when the person who monitors the efficacy of a water treatment regime may not be the
person who applies it. In such circumstances, responsibilities should be well defined in writing and understood by all concerned.
Lines of communication should be clear, unambiguous, and audited regularly to ensure they are effective. This also applies to
outside companies and consultants who may be responsible for certain parts of the control regime.
ACoP L8 – Paragraph 61 – Once the risk has been identified and assessed, a written scheme should be prepared for preventing
or controlling it. In particular, the written scheme should contain information about the water system needed to control the risk
from exposure. The written scheme should give details on how to use and carry out the various control measures and water
treatment regimes. (paragraph 62 gives guidance on what should be included).
A written scheme has not been implemented, the duty holder should appoint a competent person or water hygiene
company to implement a written scheme. The written scheme should be made site specific considering all the findings
within the current Legionella Risk Assessment and clearly identify a communication pathway and responsibilities.",,,,,,,,
