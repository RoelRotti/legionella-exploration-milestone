Infrequently used equipment within a water
"system (i.e., not used for a period equal to or"
greater than seven days) should be included on
the flushing regime. Flush the outlets until the
temperature at the outlet stabilises and is
comparable to supply water and purge to drain.
Regularly use the outlets to minimise the risk from
microbial growth in the peripheral parts of the
"water system, sustain and log this procedure once"
"started. For high risk populations, e.g., healthcare"
"and care homes, more frequent flushing may be"
required as indicated by the risk assessment.
