,,,
Drift eliminator,,,"More correctly referred to as drift reducers or minimisers – equipment containing a complex
system of baffles designed to remove water droplets from cooling tower air passing through it."
Evaporative condenser,,,"A heat exchanger in which refrigerant is condensed by a combination of air movement and
water sprays over its surface."
Evaporative cooling,,,"A process by which a small portion of a circulating body of water is caused to evaporate thereby
taking the required latent heat of evaporation from the remainder of the water and cooling it."
Fill/packing,,,"That portion of a cooling tower which constitutes its primary heat transfer surface; sometimes
called ‘packing’ or ‘pack’."
Fouling,,,Organic growth or other deposits on heat transfer surfaces causing loss of efficiency.
Half life,,,Ratio of system volume to purge rate.
Hot water service,,,"Installation of plant, pipes and fittings in which water is heated, distributed, and subsequently
discharged (not including cold water feed tank or cistern)."
Legionnaires’ disease,,,A form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria.
Legionellae,,,"The genus Legionella belongs to the family Legionellaceae which has over 40 species. These are
ubiquitous in the environment and found in a wide spectrum of natural and artificial collections
of water."
,Legionella,,Type of aerobic bacterium which is found predominantly in warm water environments.
,(singular of Legionellae),,
L.pneumophila,,,One of the causative organisms of Legionnaires’ disease.
Legionellosis,,,Any illness caused by exposure to Legionella bacteria.
Pontiac fever,,,"A disease caused by species of Legionella bacteria; an upper respiratory illness less severe than
Legionnaires’ disease."
Make up water,,,"Water which is added to a cooling water system to compensate for wastage (e.g., via system
leaks), evaporative loss and bleed."
Micro-organism,,,"An organism of microscopic size including bacteria, fungi, and viruses."
Non-oxidising biocide,,,"A non-oxidising biocide is one that functions by mechanisms other than oxidation, including
interference with cell metabolism and structure."
Nutrient,,,A food source for micro-organisms.
Oxidising biocide,,,"Agents capable of oxidising organic matter, e.g., cell material, enzymes or proteins which are
associated with microbiological populations resulting in death of the micro-organisms. The
most used oxidising biocides are based on chlorine or bromine (halogens) which liberate
hypochlorous or hypobromous acids on hydrolysis in water. The exception is chlorine dioxide, a
gas which does not hydrolyse but which functions in the same way."
Pasteurisation,,,Heat treatment to destroy micro-organism usually at high temperature.
Planktonic,,,Free floating micro-organisms in an aquatic system.
ppm,,,"Parts per million: a measure of dissolved substances given as the number of parts there are in a
million parts of solvent. It is numerically equivalent to milligrams per litre (mg/l) with respect to
water."
Pond/sump,,,Collection of cooling water at the base of a cooling tower.
