"Low use outlets, dead-legs and/or blind ends have been identified within the building at the time of visit.
HSG274 Part 2 – Paragraph 23 – First, consider whether the risk of legionella can be prevented by considering the type of water
systems needed. Where the risk cannot be prevented, a course of action must be devised to manage the risk by implementing
effective control measures. The written scheme should be specific and tailored to the systems covered by the risk assessment.
Appendix 2:2 summaries the key information, which should include the following precautions: ensuring water cannot stagnate
anywhere in the system by regular movement of water in all sections of the systems and by keeping pipe lengths as short as
possible, and/or removing redundant pipework and dead-legs.
Located on pages 35-37 within this document is information and recommendations on how to rectify the issues regarding
dead-legs, blind ends, and low use outlets. If possible, remove all located dead-leg and blind ends or implement alternative
measures to prevent stagnation within the associated pipework. Ensure all low use outlets are flushed and recorded
evidence is documented within the ‘Legionella logbook’ or equivalent.",,,,,,,,
