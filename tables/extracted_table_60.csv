For circulating systems: take temperatures at retur
"legs of subordinate loops, temperature"
measurements can be taken on the surface of pipe
"but where this is not practicable, the temperature"
of water from the last outlet on each loop may be
measured and this should be greater than 50Â°c
within one minute of running. If the temperature
"rise is slow, it should be confirmed that the outlet i"
on a long leg and not that the flow and return has
failed in that local area.
