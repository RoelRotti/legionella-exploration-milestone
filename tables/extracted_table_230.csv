Retention time,Time a chemical is retained in the system.
Scale inhibitors,"Chemicals used to control scale. They function by holding up the precipitation process and/or
distorting the crystal shape, thus preventing the build-up of a hard-adherent scale."
Sentinel taps,"For a hot water service – the first and last taps on a recirculating system.
For a cold water service (or non-recirculating hot water systems) – the nearest and furthest
taps may also include other taps which are considered to represent a particular risk."
Sessile,Aquatic micro-organisms adhering to a surface normally as part of a biofilm.
Sludge,"A general term for soft mud like deposits found on heat transfer surfaces or other important
sections of a cooling system. Also found at the base of Calorifier’s and cold water storage
tanks."
Shunt pump,"A circulation pump fitted to hot water service/plant to overcome the temperature stratification
of stored water."
Slime,Mucus like exudates which cover a surface produced by some micro-organisms.
Stagnation,The condition where water ceases to flow and is therefore liable to microbiological growth.
Strainer,"A coarse filter usually positioned upstream of a sensitive component such as a pump control
valve or heat exchanger to protect it from debris."
Thermal disinfection,Heat treatment to disinfect a system.
Thermostatic mixing valve,"Mixing valve in which the temperature at outlet is pre-selected and controlled automatically by
the valve."
Total viable count (TVC),"The total number of culturable bacteria (per volume or area) in each sample (does not include
Legionella)."
Risk assessment,"Identifying and assessing the risk from exposure to Legionella bacteria from work activities and
water sources on premises and determining any necessary precautionary measures."
Windage,"Physical loss of water from a cooling tower caused by draught of air or wind – water is lost
around the base of the cooling tower because of cross winds as opposed to drift."
